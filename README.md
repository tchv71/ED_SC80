# ED_SC80
CP/M hardware dependent SC80 text editor for RK86 60K

This editor can read/write CP/M text files but uses RK86 60k direct text screen access - therefore more fast than using standard console i/o

Text blocks and 2 text windows are supported

Makefile is for compilation on PC (using M80 and L80 wrappers from here: https://github.com/Konamiman/M80dotNet)
